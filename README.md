# To-Do List Application

## Overview
This project is a console-based To-Do List manager implemented in Python. It allows users to add, remove, and view tasks, with persistent storage using file handling. The application demonstrates key concepts such as lists, string manipulation, and file operations.

## Features
- Add tasks to your to-do list
- Remove tasks from your list
- View all tasks
- Tasks are saved in a text file for persistence

## Technologies Used
- Python (Core logic and file handling)
- VS Code / Terminal (Development and execution)

## How It Works
Tasks are managed using Python lists and are stored in a text file (`tasks.txt`). The application reads tasks from the file at startup and writes updates back to the file whenever changes are made, ensuring your to-do list is persistent across sessions.

## Usage
1. Run `todo.py` in your terminal.
2. Follow the menu prompts to add, remove, or view tasks.
3. All tasks are automatically saved and loaded from `tasks.txt`.

## Outcome
A professional, persistent CLI to-do app suitable for project submission.
